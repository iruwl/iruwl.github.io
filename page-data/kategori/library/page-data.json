However, the fact that it is Java based is irrelevant to us as transformations aren’t done in Java, but rather in Jolt’s own transformation definition format. This is the main purpose of Jolt: To be able to transform JSON without being bound to a language other than JSON. Although if Jolt’s built-in transformation operations aren’t enough for your purposes, it’s easy to extend them using the Java library.","category":"Library","title":"JSON Transformation with Jolt"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"category":"Library","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":2,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/kategori/library","nextPagePath":"/kategori/library/halaman/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
