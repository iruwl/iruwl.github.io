However, the fact that it is Java based is irrelevant to us as transformations aren’t done in Java, but rather in Jolt’s own transformation definition format. This is the main purpose of Jolt: To be able to transform JSON without being bound to a language other than JSON. Although if Jolt’s built-in transformation operations aren’t enough for your purposes, it’s easy to extend them using the Java library."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/catetan/install-mongodb-community-edition-on-ubuntu-18.04/","categorySlug":"/kategori/database/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Install MongoDB Community Edition on Ubuntu 18.04","date":"2019-10-24","category":"Database","description":"The following tutorial uses a package manager to install MongoDB 4.2 Community Edition on LTS Ubuntu 18.04 Linux systems."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"currentPage":0,"postsLimit":2,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/","nextPagePath":"/halaman/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":true}}}
